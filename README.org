#+TITLE: The Habilis (a keyboard)

Habilis is a split concave keyboard, heavily inspired from the [[https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard][Dactyl]],
but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability][designed for manufacturing]].  As such, its production requires
neither 3D printing nor precision bending, but 2D laser cutting and a
screwdriver, plus the usual tools (PCB manufacturing, some
soldering, some programming, microcontroller boards).
