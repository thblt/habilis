#+TITLE: The Habilis (a keyboard)

Habilis is a split concave keyboard, heavily inspired from the [[https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard][Dactyl]], but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability][designed for manufacturing]].  As such, its production requires neither 3D printing nor precision bending, but 2D laser cutting (a future update /may/ require 3D cutting) and a screwdriver, plus the usual suspects (PCB manufacturing, and so on).

* Notes

Connector: GX12â€¯can be a nice alternative to jack

Just an idea, for layouts where numbers are uppercase: create a number-caps-lock key that will keep the keyboard capslocked until a non-number key is pressed [ deactivates capslock before sending the corresponding keycode ]
